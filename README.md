This application is designed to be an executable file that works with a Microsoft Access Database.
The main purpose is to be able to search for the total number of hours per 'Contract Name'.
In addition to the main search function, there is an added advanced search that allows the user to 
pick a month and/ or year to narrow the results. The application also allows users to upload and 
delete entries from the Microsoft Access Database. All information is displayed in a treeview which 
can be converted into a PDF, which the user can save to a chosen location to access later.
